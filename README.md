**Front-End Development Quiz**

  The Front-End Development Quiz is an engaging web application designed to test users' knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through 25 carefully curated questions. With a 30-second timer per question and 2 points awarded for each correct answer, it offers a dynamic and challenging experience. The quiz features a modern glassmorphism interface with a vibrant teal-to-purple gradient, ensuring visual appeal and responsiveness across devices. Key functionalities include randomized question order, a smooth progress bar (0% to 100%), instant feedback, and an accessible end screen with a centered restart button. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and enhanced with ARIA attributes for accessibility, this project is licensed under MIT and welcomes contributions.
